      Looking to rent a house or apartment near Berkeley or Stanford
      through Craigslist and want to easily visualize where all the
      homes are?
    </p>
    
    <p class = "description">
      Try my housing mashup for:
      <ul>
        <li><a href="http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~tadayuki/housing/sfbay-eby.html">Berkeley</a></li>
        <li><a href="http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~tadayuki/housing/sfbay-sfc.html">San Francisco</a></li>
        <li><a href="http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~tadayuki/housing/sfbay-pen.html">Stanford</a></li>

      <h3>Instructions:</h3>
    </p>

    <p class="desciption">
      When the page first loads, you'll see a bunch of blue markers
      and a red marker.  The blue markers all correspond to houses
      (with lighter shades of blue corresponding to cheaper
      houses). The red marker is used to narrow down the houses that
      will be displayed. The map will only display houses that are
      within X miles of the red marker where X is a setting you can
      change at the top of the page.  Drag the red marker around to
      move it.  The circle indicates the search area for houses.  You can also filter the houses to display by price
      "X-Y" where X and Y are dollar amounts, and by the number of
      bedrooms "1+", "2", "2 3 4", etc.  By default, it only searches 
      homes that do NOT allow pets, but you can uncheck the no pets box 
      to search for only homes that DO allow pets.  Note that if you relax the
      filters to display many homes at once, your computer will slow
      down as it loads all the homes.
    </p>

    <p class = "description">
      Click on a blue marker to pop open the description corresponding
      to that home.  You can click on the "Craigslist ad" link in the
      description to see the original Craigslist ad.  This will also
      highlight the description in the table on the right.  Similarly,
      if you find a description you like on the right, click on it to
      locate that unit on the map and open its description.
    </p>

    <p class = "description">
      The listings should update themselves at least once a day.  You
      can find out the last time they were updated at the top right of
      each page.  If you are actively using it to search for a house
      and more time has gone by, let me know.  No promises that I'll
      fix it soon, but I will try if I have the time. Also, it only
      scrapes listings that have pictures since I do not bother with
      housing ads that do not have any pictures.
    </p>

    <p class = "description">
      If you use this to find a place, drop me a line to let me know!
      My email address is on my personal page.

      This was originally developed by Kurt Miller; he has generously allowed
      me to continue hosting this useful script here. Below is his original
      disclaimer, which still applies today.

      "<b>Disclaimer:</b> I developed this for my own personal use and found
      it to be useful, so I am making it available to others.
      However, I'm not actively supporting it.  It is JavaScript
      heavy, so may be slower or not even work with particular
      browsers.  <i>In particular, I have not tested it at all with
      Internet Explorer.</i>  Sorry if it does not work for you.  This was
      heavily influenced by an earlier version by Percy Liang that I
      had used that is no longer supported due to Google Maps API
      changes."
